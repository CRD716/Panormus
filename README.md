# Panormus
## Panormus is a very simple, open source, encrypted text editor.

### Installation
If you want or have to use python instead of the exe, it's simple to install.
Once downloaded, simply navigate inside the Panormus folder and install from the requirements.
`pip install -r requirements.txt`

### Usage
Make sure to save your key outside of just your clipboard. There is a strange issue where copying from the key input will not actually save it to the clipboard.
On first use, copy and save your key somewhere safe. Once entered, begin writing normally. Save files normally. To open files after restarting, paste in your key (ignore new ones).
